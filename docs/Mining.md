# Mining Guide

GAS supports two types of miners that work together in an adversarial loop:

## [Discriminative Mining](Discriminative-Mining.md) ðŸ“–
Miners run classifiers that detect AI-generated content. They receive images or videos and predict whether the media is real, fully synthetic, or partially modified by AI.

## [Generative Mining](Generative-Mining.md) ðŸŽ¨
Miners create synthetic media that challenges the discriminators. They generate increasingly realistic content to test and improve detection capabilities.
