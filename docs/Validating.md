### Before you proceed ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Ensure you are running Subtensor locally** to minimize outages and improve performance. See [Run a Subtensor Node Locally](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/docs/running-subtensor-locally.md#compiling-your-own-binary).

**Be aware of the minimum compute requirements** for our subnet, detailed in [Minimum compute YAML configuration](../min_compute.yml). A GPU is recommended for training, although not required for basic inference.

### Installation

Download the repository and navigate to the folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitmind-ai/bitmind-subnet.git && cd bitmind-subnet
```

We recommend using a Conda virtual environment to install the necessary Python packages.<br>
You can set up Conda with this [quick command-line install](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install), and create a virtual environment with this command:

```bash
conda create -y -n bitmind python=3.10 ipython jupyter ipykernel
```

To activate your virtual environment, run `conda activate bitmind`. To deactivate, `conda deactivate`.

Install the remaining necessary requirements with the following chained command.

```bash
conda activate bitmind
export PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1
chmod +x setup_validator_env.sh 
./setup_validator_env.sh
```

### Data

You can download the necessary datasets by running:

```bash
python bitmind/download_data.py
```

- For **validators**, we recommend you do this prior to registering and running your validator. The download can take up to a few hours. Please note the minimum storage requirements specified in `min_compute.yml`.

- For **miners**, this is only necessary when training a new model. Deployed miner instances do not need access to these datasets.

### Registration

To validate on our subnet, must have a registered hotkey.

#### Mainnet

```bash
btcli s register --netuid 34 --wallet.name [wallet_name] --wallet.hotkey [wallet.hotkey] --subtensor.network finney
```

#### Testnet

```bash
btcli s register --netuid 168 --wallet.name [wallet_name] --wallet.hotkey [wallet.hotkey] --subtensor.network test
```

---

## Validating

You can launch your validator with `run_neuron.py`.

First, make sure to update `validator.env` with your **wallet**, **hotkey**, and **validator port**. This file was created for you during setup, and is not tracked by git.

```bash
NETUID=34 # or 168 
SUBTENSOR_NETWORK=finney # or test
SUBTENSOR_CHAIN_ENDPOINT=wss://entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai:443 # or wss://test.finney.opentensor.ai:443/
WALLET_NAME=default
WALLET_HOTKEY=default
VALIDATOR_AXON_PORT=8092
```

Then, log into weights and biases by running `wandb login` and entering your API key. If you don't have an API key, please reach out to the BitMind team via Discord and we can provide one. 

Now you're ready to run your validator!

```bash
conda activate bitmind
pm2 start run_neuron.py -- --validator 
```

- Auto updates are enabled by default. To disable, run with `--no-auto-updates`.
- Self-healing restarts are enabled by default (every 6 hours). To disable, run with `--no-self-heal`.
