# GAS Q3 Roadmap

This document outlines our Q3 roadmap for GAS, aimed at pushing the boundaries of Bittensor. Key objectives include enabling 100x scaling of our applications, ensuring robust data privacy for enterprise customers, and fostering an adversarial environment to challenge the subnet's computer vision classification models with State-of-the-Art (SoTA) generative model data. We're implementing this through a phased rollout to deliver scalable, secure, and innovative AI commodity of distinguishing reality.

| **July 17, 2025**   | V3                      | Native Resolution Rollout                    | Upgrades to native resolutions with real-time scraping, further aligning scored challenges with real-world data.                                                       |
| **July 24, 2025**   | Phase I Launch          | GAS Phase I: Discriminative Model Submission | Enables discriminator model submissions, secure evaluations, and cloud-hosted infrastructure for efficient API detection requests, with incentives for top performers. |
| **July 30, 2025**   | Phase I                 | Full Discriminative Rollout                  | Provides discriminator evaluation optimization, optimized logging and testing suite, and maintenance of the discriminator miner lifecycle.                             |
| **August 14, 2025** | Phase II Minimal Launch | GAS Phase II: Generative Revolution          | Introduces generative miners, a growing dataset, prompt-aligned validation, and rewards for high-quality outputs that challenge discriminators.                        |
| **August 30, 2025** | Phase II                | Full Generative Rollout                      | Features perpetual dataset growth, advanced validation, and updated incentives to promote SoTA-level model quality data generation.                                    |

**Post-August Plans:** We will optimize generator challenges to focus on incentivizing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) model data generation, ensuring high-quality contributions. Additionally, we plan to update the discriminator miners scoring mechanism to a Glicko Rating system, enabling head-to-head competitions for improved accuracy and rewards. These enhancements will continue to evolve GAS in Q4.
