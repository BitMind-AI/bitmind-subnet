Welcome to the BitMind Subnet! This repository contains all the necessary information to get started, understand our subnet architecture, and contribute.

## The BitMind Platform

The [BitMind platform](https://app.bitmindlabs.ai/) offers a best-in-class developer experience for Bittensor miners. 

‚ö° **Access Compute**: We offer a wide variety of CPU and GPU options<br>
‚ö° **Develop in VSCode**: Develop in a feature-rich IDE (we support Jupyter too if you hate rich features)<br>
‚ö° **Fully Managed Devops:** No more tinkering with networking configuration - register and deploy your miner in just a few clicks <br>
‚ö° **Monitor Emissions:** View the emissions for all of your miners in our Miner Dashboard

## Identifying AI-Generated Media with a Decentralized Framework

**Overview:**
The BitMind Subnet leverages advanced generative and discriminative AI models within the Bittensor network to detect AI-generated images. This platform is engineered on a decentralized, incentive-driven framework to enhance trustworthiness and stimulate continuous technological advancement.

**Purpose:**
The proliferation of generative AI models has significantly increased the production of high-quality synthetic media, presenting challenges in distinguishing these from authentic content. The BitMind Subnet addresses this challenge by providing robust detection mechanisms to maintain the integrity of digital media.

**Features:**

- **Applications:** See [our applications page](https://www.bitmindlabs.ai/apps) for a list of applications that leverage the BitMind Subnet to detect AI-generated media

- **Model Evolution:** Our platform continuously integrates the latest research and developments in AI to adapt to evolving generative techniques.

**Core Components:**

- **Miners:** Tasked with running binary classifiers that discern between genuine and AI-generated content.
  - **Research Integration:** We systematically update our detection models and methodologies in response to emerging academic research, offering resources like training codes and model weights to our community.
- **Validators:** Responsible for challenging miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic images, drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
  - **Resource Expansion:** We are committed to enhancing the validators' capabilities by increasing the diversity and volume of the image pool, which supports rigorous testing and validation processes.
