# This file is a placeholder. The actual supervisord configuration is
# generated at container startup by /app/docker/entrypoint.sh, which
# translates environment variables into the correct CLI arguments for
# each validator process.
#
# The generated config is written to /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf
# and contains 3 program sections:
#   - sn34-validator   (neurons/validator/validator.py)
#   - sn34-generator   (neurons/validator/services/generator_service.py)
#   - sn34-data        (neurons/validator/services/data_service.py)
